# fractol

This project’s goal is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what a fractal is.

The constraints are as follows:

• Your software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals, including the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set. The third fractal (and the optional additional ones) can be whatever you want.

• It must be possible to make the parameter of the Julia set vary only with the mouse (without clicking). For the other types of fractal, the decision is yours.

• The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer). This is the very principle of fractals.

• You must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal. It’s even better if you hack away on psychedelic effects.

• A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be viewed. If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits properly.

As for the graphic representation:

• ESC will exit the program.

• The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.
